**Note:** This post summarizes my backend development experience using RPA tools at Accenture.

In early 2024, I worked at Accenture in Sevilla as an **RPA Backend Developer**, where I helped automate business processes through the development and maintenance of RPA robots. My work involved:

- Monitoring and maintaining existing robots
- Investigating and resolving technical incidents
- Writing technical documentation
- Designing and building new robots to automate repetitive tasks

## What I Learned

1. **Enterprise Workflow Understanding:** I learned how large organizations manage and optimize repetitive tasks.
2. **Incident Resolution:** Real-time problem-solving improved my troubleshooting skills and understanding of software reliability.
3. **Documentation Rigor:** I improved my ability to write concise, precise documentation for technical and non-technical audiences.

## Challenges Faced

1. **Tool-Specific Learning Curve:** Adapting to RPA tools required quick learning.
2. **Process Complexity:** Understanding undocumented business logic sometimes slowed implementation.
3. **Bot Maintenance:** Debugging bots required careful step-by-step inspection.

> Automation is not about replacing people â€” it's about freeing them to do more meaningful work.

This experience strengthened my backend and analytical skills and gave me a practical view of how automation can enhance business operations.
