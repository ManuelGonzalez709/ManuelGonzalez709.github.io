**Note:** This post details my full stack development experience at WUL4 in 2025.

At WUL4, I built a responsive web application by combining backend and frontend technologies:

- Developed a **RESTful API** with Spring Boot for managing data and business logic
- Designed a responsive **frontend with React and TailwindCSS**
- Used Git and GitHub for version control in a collaborative workflow

## Skills Applied

1. **Clean Code Practices:** Learned to structure both Java and JavaScript code for clarity and reusability.
2. **Frontend-Backend Communication:** Understood how to design RESTful endpoints for a React frontend.
3. **Team Collaboration:** Collaborated via GitHub with other developers and practiced agile methodologies.

## What I Found Challenging

1. **Syncing APIs with Frontend:** Ensuring consistent data flow between frontend and backend required careful planning.
2. **UI Consistency:** TailwindCSS required precision in class management for consistent design.
3. **Deployment Readiness:** Preparing the app for deployment added extra QA and configuration steps.

> Building full stack applications taught me how each layer contributes to the final product.

This internship solidified my desire to grow as a full stack developer and confirmed my passion for delivering complete, functional applications.
