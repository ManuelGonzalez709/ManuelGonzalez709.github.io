**Note:** This post reflects on my first real-world coding experience in Italy.

In 2022, I joined **EXAGOGICA SRL** in Italy as part of an international internship program. I worked on:

- Developing a software module for an ERP system
- Refactoring and optimizing existing code
- Writing technical documentation for maintainability

## Highlights

1. **Code Optimization:** I understood the importance of efficiency and performance when writing backend logic.
2. **Documentation Discipline:** Creating clear documentation for future maintainers was a key task.
3. **International Work Culture:** Communicating in a multicultural environment improved both my technical and soft skills.

## Lessons from the Experience

1. **Language Adaptation:** Working in an English-speaking environment helped improve my fluency.
2. **Responsibility:** Despite being an intern, I was given ownership over real modules.
3. **Version Control:** I gained practical experience with Git in a professional setting.

> My first coding job abroad showed me that great software starts with strong fundamentals.

This internship was the springboard for my career in software development and confirmed my interest in backend engineering.
